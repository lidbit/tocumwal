            <h3>Heritage Listing</h3>
            <h4>Statement of Signifigance</h4>
            <P>
                The Tocumwal Housing Precinct in O'Connor is significant as an outstanding example of low cost pre-fabricated housing, which was constructed in Canberra after World War 2.
            </P>
            <p>
                As part of the Government's solution to the critical housing shortage being experienced in Canberra at the time, many of the houses originally constructed at Tocumwal in NSW for the US Army Air Corps were re-erected in the ACT. The cottages are of distinctive design types and limited geographically to the O'Connor Precinct and a small area in Ainslie.
            </p>
            <p>
                    The Precinct remains the most intact example of this style of housing and is unique in Canberra for its urban planning, landscaping and social history.
            </p>
            <p>
                    The eight culs de sac evident in the precinct share access onto a community recreation area with the individual identity of each street reinforced by the street plantings. Many of the cottages retain their original hedge plantings. The 'precinctual' planning is thus significant.
            </p>
            <p>
                    The sense of cohesion of the streetscapes within the Precinct is achieved by the repetition of features in the housing stock, and the integration of this with unifying street plantings and hedges. It creates an area of high aesthetic value.
            </p>
